Using LSTM to forecast an hour ahead of a solar powerplant ouput <br>
This code was made to forecast an hour ahead output of a specific power plant in the Pampanga, Philippines. <br>
All of the data used were part of historical performances of a specific powerplant <br>

<h1> Government Regulations </h1> <br>
Since we are in need to comply with certain regulations prompted by the government, <br>
I made this algorithm to forecast the power plant's output in MegaWatt with basis. <br>

With only a max of 30% MAPE requirement, the power plant's MAPE as of July 2023 is **_6.7%_** with the help of this program algorithm
Which means that using the program is really helpful in forecasting the plant's hour ahead bids.  <br>
