Using LSTM to forecast an hour ahead of a solar powerplant ouput
This code was made to forecast an hour ahead output of a specific power plant in the Pampanga, Philippines.
All of the data used were part of historical performances of a specific powerplant

Government Regulations /n
Since we are in need to comply with certain regulations prompted by the government,
I made this algorithm to forecast the power plant's output in MegaWatt with basis. 

With only a max of 30% MAPE requirement, the power plant's MAPE as of July 2023 is **_6.7%_** with the help of this program algorithm
Which means that using the program is really helpful in forecasting the plant's hour ahead bids.
