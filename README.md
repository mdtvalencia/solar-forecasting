Using LSTM to forecast an hour ahead of a solar powerplant ouput<br>
This code was made to forecast an hour ahead output of a specific power plant in the Pampanga, Philippines.<br>
All of the data used were part of historical performances of a specific powerplant<br>

<b>Government Regulations</b> <br>
Since we are in need to comply with certain regulations prompted by the government,<br>
I made this algorithm to forecast the power plant's output in MegaWatt with basis. <br>

With only a max of 30% MAPE requirement, the power plant's MAPE as of July 2023 is **_6.7%_** with the help of this program algorithm
Which means that using the program is really helpful in forecasting the plant's hour ahead bids.  <br>

Performance metrics<br>
**The R2 score is:  79.13479604623069**<br>
**The R score is:  88.95774055484475**<br>
